<doc f='codebrowser/Include/pyarena.h' l='14'>/* PyArena_New() and PyArena_Free() create a new arena and free it,
     respectively.  Once an arena has been created, it can be used
     to allocate memory via PyArena_Malloc().  Pointers to PyObject can
     also be registered with the arena via PyArena_AddPyObject(), and the
     arena will ensure that the PyObjects stay alive at least until
     PyArena_Free() is called.  When an arena is freed, all the memory it
     allocated is freed, the arena releases internal references to registered
     PyObject*, and none of its pointers are valid.
     XXX (tim) What does &quot;none of its pointers are valid&quot; mean?  Does it
     XXX mean that pointers previously obtained via PyArena_Malloc() are
     XXX no longer valid?  (That&apos;s clearly true, but not sure that&apos;s what
     XXX the text is trying to say.)

     PyArena_New() returns an arena pointer.  On error, it
     returns a negative number and sets an exception.
     XXX (tim):  Not true.  On error, PyArena_New() actually returns NULL,
     XXX and looks like it may or may not set an exception (e.g., if the
     XXX internal PyList_New(0) returns NULL, PyArena_New() passes that on
     XXX and an exception is set; OTOH, if the internal
     XXX block_new(DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE) returns NULL, that&apos;s passed on but
     XXX an exception is not set in that case).

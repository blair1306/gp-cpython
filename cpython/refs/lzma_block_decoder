 * Valid actions for lzma_code() are LZMA_RUN and LZMA_FINISH. Using
 * LZMA_FINISH is not required. It is supported only for convenience.

 * \return      - LZMA_OK: All good, continue with lzma_code().
 *              - LZMA_UNSUPPORTED_CHECK: Initialization was successful, but
 *                the given Check ID is not supported, thus Check will be
 *                ignored.

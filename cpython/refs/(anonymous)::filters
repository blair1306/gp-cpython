	 * \brief       Array of filters
	 *
	 * There can be 1-4 filters. The end of the array is marked with
	 * .id = LZMA_VLI_UNKNOWN.
	 *
	 * Read by:
	 *  - lzma_block_header_size()
	 *  - lzma_block_header_encode()
	 *  - lzma_block_encoder()
	 *  - lzma_block_decoder()
	 *  - lzma_block_buffer_encode()
	 *  - lzma_block_buffer_decode()
	 *
	 * Written by:
	 *  - lzma_block_header_decode(): Note that this does NOT free()
	 *    the old filter options structures. All unused filters[] will
	 *    have .id == LZMA_VLI_UNKNOWN and .options == NULL. If
	 *    decoding fails, all filters[] are guaranteed to be
	 *    LZMA_VLI_UNKNOWN and NULL.
	 *
	 * \note        Because of the array is terminated with
	 *              .id = LZMA_VLI_UNKNOWN, the actual array must
	 *              have LZMA_FILTERS_MAX + 1 members or the Block
	 *              Header decoder will overflow the buffer.

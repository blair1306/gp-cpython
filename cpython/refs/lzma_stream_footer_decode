 * \brief       Decode Stream Footer
 *
 * \param       options     Target for the decoded Stream Header options.
 * \param       in          Beginning of the input buffer of
 *                          LZMA_STREAM_HEADER_SIZE bytes.
 *
 * \return      - LZMA_OK: Decoding was successful.
 *              - LZMA_FORMAT_ERROR: Magic bytes don&apos;t match, thus the given
 *                buffer cannot be Stream Footer.
 *              - LZMA_DATA_ERROR: CRC32 doesn&apos;t match, thus the Stream Footer
 *                is corrupt.
 *              - LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR: Unsupported options are present
 *                in Stream Footer.
 *
 * \note        If Stream Header was already decoded successfully, but
 *              decoding Stream Footer returns LZMA_FORMAT_ERROR, the
 *              application should probably report some other error message
 *              than &quot;file format not recognized&quot;, since the file more likely
 *              is corrupt (possibly truncated). Stream decoder in liblzma
 *              uses LZMA_DATA_ERROR in this situation.

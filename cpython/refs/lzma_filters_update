 * \brief       Update the filter chain in the encoder
 *
 * This function is for advanced users only. This function has two slightly
 * different purposes:
 *
 *  - After LZMA_FULL_FLUSH when using Stream encoder: Set a new filter
 *    chain, which will be used starting from the next Block.
 *
 *  - After LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH using Raw, Block, or Stream encoder: Change
 *    the filter-specific options in the middle of encoding. The actual
 *    filters in the chain (Filter IDs) cannot be changed. In the future,
 *    it might become possible to change the filter options without
 *    using LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH.
 *
 * While rarely useful, this function may be called also when no data has
 * been compressed yet. In that case, this function will behave as if
 * LZMA_FULL_FLUSH (Stream encoder) or LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH (Raw or Block
 * encoder) had been used right before calling this function.
 *
 * \return      - LZMA_OK
 *              - LZMA_MEM_ERROR
 *              - LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR
 *              - LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR
 *              - LZMA_PROG_ERROR

 * \brief       Allocate and initialize a new lzma_index_hash structure
 *
 * If index_hash is NULL, a new lzma_index_hash structure is allocated,
 * initialized, and a pointer to it returned. If allocation fails, NULL
 * is returned.
 *
 * If index_hash is non-NULL, it is reinitialized and the same pointer
 * returned. In this case, return value cannot be NULL or a different
 * pointer than the index_hash that was given as an argument.

	 * \brief       Start offset for conversions
	 *
	 * This setting is useful only when the same filter is used
	 * _separately_ for multiple sections of the same executable file,
	 * and the sections contain cross-section branch/call/jump
	 * instructions. In that case it is beneficial to set the start
	 * offset of the non-first sections so that the relative addresses
	 * of the cross-section branch/call/jump instructions will use the
	 * same absolute addresses as in the first section.
	 *
	 * When the pointer to options is NULL, the default value (zero)
	 * is used.

	 * \brief       Pointer to an initial dictionary
	 *
	 * It is possible to initialize the LZ77 history window using
	 * a preset dictionary. It is useful when compressing many
	 * similar, relatively small chunks of data independently from
	 * each other. The preset dictionary should contain typical
	 * strings that occur in the files being compressed. The most
	 * probable strings should be near the end of the preset dictionary.
	 *
	 * This feature should be used only in special situations. For
	 * now, it works correctly only with raw encoding and decoding.
	 * Currently none of the container formats supported by
	 * liblzma allow preset dictionary when decoding, thus if
	 * you create a .xz or .lzma file with preset dictionary, it
	 * cannot be decoded with the regular decoder functions. In the
	 * future, the .xz format will likely get support for preset
	 * dictionary though.

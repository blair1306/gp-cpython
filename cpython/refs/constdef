<doc f='codebrowser/Modules/posixmodule.c' l='9486'>/* This is used for fpathconf(), pathconf(), confstr() and sysconf().
 * It maps strings representing configuration variable names to
 * integer values, allowing those functions to be called with the
 * magic names instead of polluting the module&apos;s namespace with tons of
 * rarely-used constants.  There are three separate tables that use
 * these definitions.
 *
 * This code is always included, even if none of the interfaces that
 * need it are included.  The #if hackery needed to avoid it would be
 * sufficiently pervasive that it&apos;s not worth the loss of readability.

		 * \brief       Cannot calculate the integrity check
		 *
		 * The usage of this return value is different in encoders
		 * and decoders.
		 *
		 * Encoders can return this value only from the initialization
		 * function. If initialization fails with this value, the
		 * encoding cannot be done, because there&apos;s no way to produce
		 * output with the correct integrity check.
		 *
		 * Decoders can return this value only from lzma_code() and
		 * only if the LZMA_TELL_UNSUPPORTED_CHECK flag was used when
		 * initializing the decoder. The decoding can still be
		 * continued normally even if the check type is unsupported,
		 * but naturally the check will not be validated, and possible
		 * errors may go undetected.
		 *
		 * With decoder, it is possible to call lzma_get_check()
		 * immediately after lzma_code() has returned
		 * LZMA_UNSUPPORTED_CHECK. This way it is possible to find
		 * out what the unsupported Check ID was.

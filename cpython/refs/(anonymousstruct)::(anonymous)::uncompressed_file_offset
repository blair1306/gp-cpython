		 * \brief       Uncompressed start offset of this Block
		 *
		 * This offset is relative to the beginning of the lzma_index
		 * (i.e. usually the beginning of the .xz file).
		 *
		 * When doing random-access reading, it is possible that
		 * the target offset is not exactly at Block boundary. One
		 * will need to compare the target offset against
		 * uncompressed_file_offset or uncompressed_stream_offset,
		 * and possibly decode and throw away some amount of data
		 * before reaching the target offset.

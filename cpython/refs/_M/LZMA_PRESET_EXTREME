 * \brief       Extreme compression preset
 *
 * This flag modifies the preset to make the encoding significantly slower
 * while improving the compression ratio only marginally. This is useful
 * when you don&apos;t mind wasting time to get as small result as possible.
 *
 * This flag doesn&apos;t affect the memory usage requirements of the decoder (at
 * least not significantly). The memory usage of the encoder may be increased
 * a little but only at the lowest preset levels (0-3).

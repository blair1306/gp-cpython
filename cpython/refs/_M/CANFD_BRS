 * defined bits for canfd_frame.flags
 *
 * The use of struct canfd_frame implies the Extended Data Length (EDL) bit to
 * be set in the CAN frame bitstream on the wire. The EDL bit switch turns
 * the CAN controllers bitstream processor into the CAN FD mode which creates
 * two new options within the CAN FD frame specification:
 *
 * Bit Rate Switch - to indicate a second bitrate is/was used for the payload
 * Error State Indicator - represents the error state of the transmitting node
 *
 * As the CANFD_ESI bit is internally generated by the transmitting CAN
 * controller only the CANFD_BRS bit is relevant for real CAN controllers when
 * building a CAN FD frame for transmission. Setting the CANFD_ESI bit can make
 * sense for virtual CAN interfaces to test applications with echoed frames.

 * This flag enables decoding of concatenated files with file formats that
 * allow concatenating compressed files as is. From the formats currently
 * supported by liblzma, only the .xz format allows concatenated files.
 * Concatenated files are not allowed with the legacy .lzma format.
 *
 * This flag also affects the usage of the `action&apos; argument for lzma_code().
 * When LZMA_CONCATENATED is used, lzma_code() won&apos;t return LZMA_STREAM_END
 * unless LZMA_FINISH is used as `action&apos;. Thus, the application has to set
 * LZMA_FINISH in the same way as it does when encoding.
 *
 * If LZMA_CONCATENATED is not used, the decoders still accept LZMA_FINISH
 * as `action&apos; for lzma_code(), but the usage of LZMA_FINISH isn&apos;t required.

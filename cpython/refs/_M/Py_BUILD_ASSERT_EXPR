   Your compile will fail if the condition isn&apos;t true, or can&apos;t be evaluated
   by the compiler. This can be used in an expression: its value is 0.

   Example:

   #define foo_to_char(foo)  \
       ((char *)(foo)        \
        + Py_BUILD_ASSERT_EXPR(offsetof(struct foo, string) == 0))

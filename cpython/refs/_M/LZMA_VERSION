 * \brief       Compile-time version number
 *
 * The version number is of format xyyyzzzs where
 *  - x = major
 *  - yyy = minor
 *  - zzz = revision
 *  - s indicates stability: 0 = alpha, 1 = beta, 2 = stable
 *
 * The same xyyyzzz triplet is never reused with different stability levels.
 * For example, if 5.1.0alpha has been released, there will never be 5.1.0beta
 * or 5.1.0 stable.
 *
 * \note        The version number of liblzma has nothing to with
 *              the version number of Igor Pavlov&apos;s LZMA SDK.

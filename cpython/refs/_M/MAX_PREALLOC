<doc f='codebrowser/Objects/stringlib/split.h' l='7'>/* Overallocate the initial list to reduce the number of reallocs for small
   split sizes.  Eg, &quot;A A A A A A A A A A&quot;.split() (10 elements) has three
   resizes, to sizes 4, 8, then 16.  Most observed string splits are for human
   text (roughly 11 words per line) and field delimited data (usually 1-10
   fields).  For large strings the split algorithms are bandwidth limited
   so increasing the preallocation likely will not improve things.*/</doc>

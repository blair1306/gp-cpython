 * The values for Py_HASH_SIPHASH24 and Py_HASH_FNV are hard-coded in the
 * configure script.
 *
 * - FNV is available on all platforms and architectures.
 * - SIPHASH24 only works on plaforms that don&apos;t require aligned memory for integers.
 * - With EXTERNAL embedders can provide an alternative implementation with::
 *
 *     PyHash_FuncDef PyHash_Func = {...};
 *
 * XXX: Figure out __declspec() for extern PyHash_FuncDef.

 * \brief       Decode the Block Header Size field
 *
 * To decode Block Header using lzma_block_header_decode(), the size of the
 * Block Header has to be known and stored into lzma_block.header_size.
 * The size can be calculated from the first byte of a Block using this macro.
 * Note that if the first byte is 0x00, it indicates beginning of Index; use
 * this macro only when the byte is not 0x00.
 *
 * There is no encoding macro, because Block Header encoder is enough for that.

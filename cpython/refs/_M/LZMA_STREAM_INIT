 * \brief       Initialization for lzma_stream
 *
 * When you declare an instance of lzma_stream, you can immediately
 * initialize it so that initialization functions know that no memory
 * has been allocated yet:
 *
 *     lzma_stream strm = LZMA_STREAM_INIT;
 *
 * If you need to initialize a dynamically allocated lzma_stream, you can use
 * memset(strm_pointer, 0, sizeof(lzma_stream)). Strictly speaking, this
 * violates the C standard since NULL may have different internal
 * representation than zero, but it should be portable enough in practice.
 * Anyway, for maximum portability, you can use something like this:
 *
 *     lzma_stream tmp = LZMA_STREAM_INIT;
 *     *strm = tmp;

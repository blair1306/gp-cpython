 * \brief       Set a compression preset to lzma_options_lzma structure
 *
 * 0 is the fastest and 9 is the slowest. These match the switches -0 .. -9
 * of the xz command line tool. In addition, it is possible to bitwise-or
 * flags to the preset. Currently only LZMA_PRESET_EXTREME is supported.
 * The flags are defined in container.h, because the flags are used also
 * with lzma_easy_encoder().
 *
 * The preset values are subject to changes between liblzma versions.
 *
 * This function is available only if LZMA1 or LZMA2 encoder has been enabled
 * when building liblzma.
 *
 * \return      On success, false is returned. If the preset is not
 *              supported, true is returned.

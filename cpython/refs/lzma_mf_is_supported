 * \brief       Test if given match finder is supported
 *
 * Return true if the given match finder is supported by this liblzma build.
 * Otherwise false is returned. It is safe to call this with a value that
 * isn&apos;t listed in lzma_match_finder enumeration; the return value will be
 * false.
 *
 * There is no way to list which match finders are available in this
 * particular liblzma version and build. It would be useless, because
 * a new match finder, which the application developer wasn&apos;t aware,
 * could require giving additional options to the encoder that the older
 * match finders don&apos;t need.

 * \brief       Calculate output buffer size for single-call Stream encoder
 *
 * When trying to compress uncompressible data, the encoded size will be
 * slightly bigger than the input data. This function calculates how much
 * output buffer space is required to be sure that lzma_stream_buffer_encode()
 * doesn&apos;t return LZMA_BUF_ERROR.
 *
 * The calculated value is not exact, but it is guaranteed to be big enough.
 * The actual maximum output space required may be slightly smaller (up to
 * about 100 bytes). This should not be a problem in practice.
 *
 * If the calculated maximum size doesn&apos;t fit into size_t or would make the
 * Stream grow past LZMA_VLI_MAX (which should never happen in practice),
 * zero is returned to indicate the error.
 *
 * \note        The limit calculated by this function applies only to
 *              single-call encoding. Multi-call encoding may (and probably
 *              will) have larger maximum expansion when encoding
 *              uncompressible data. Currently there is no function to
 *              calculate the maximum expansion of multi-call encoding.

 * \brief       Concatenate lzma_indexes
 *
 * Concatenating lzma_indexes is useful when doing random-access reading in
 * multi-Stream .xz file, or when combining multiple Streams into single
 * Stream.
 *
 * \param       dest      lzma_index after which src is appended
 * \param       src       lzma_index to be appended after dest. If this
 *                        function succeeds, the memory allocated for src
 *                        is freed or moved to be part of dest, and all
 *                        iterators pointing to src will become invalid.
 * \param       allocator Custom memory allocator; can be NULL to use
 *                        malloc() and free().
 *
 * \return      - LZMA_OK: lzma_indexes were concatenated successfully.
 *                src is now a dangling pointer.
 *              - LZMA_DATA_ERROR: *dest would grow too big.
 *              - LZMA_MEM_ERROR
 *              - LZMA_PROG_ERROR

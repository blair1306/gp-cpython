 * \brief       Copy the filters array
 *
 * Copy the Filter IDs and filter-specific options from src to dest.
 * Up to LZMA_FILTERS_MAX filters are copied, plus the terminating
 * .id == LZMA_VLI_UNKNOWN. Thus, dest should have at least
 * LZMA_FILTERS_MAX + 1 elements space unless the caller knows that
 * src is smaller than that.
 *
 * Unless the filter-specific options is NULL, the Filter ID has to be
 * supported by liblzma, because liblzma needs to know the size of every
 * filter-specific options structure. The filter-specific options are not
 * validated. If options is NULL, any unsupported Filter IDs are copied
 * without returning an error.
 *
 * Old filter-specific options in dest are not freed, so dest doesn&apos;t
 * need to be initialized by the caller in any way.
 *
 * If an error occurs, memory possibly already allocated by this function
 * is always freed.
 *
 * \return      - LZMA_OK
 *              - LZMA_MEM_ERROR
 *              - LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR: Unsupported Filter ID and its options
 *                is not NULL.
 *              - LZMA_PROG_ERROR: src or dest is NULL.

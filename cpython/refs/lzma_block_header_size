 * \brief       Calculate Block Header Size
 *
 * Calculate the minimum size needed for the Block Header field using the
 * settings specified in the lzma_block structure. Note that it is OK to
 * increase the calculated header_size value as long as it is a multiple of
 * four and doesn&apos;t exceed LZMA_BLOCK_HEADER_SIZE_MAX. Increasing header_size
 * just means that lzma_block_header_encode() will add Header Padding.
 *
 * \return      - LZMA_OK: Size calculated successfully and stored to
 *                block-&gt;header_size.
 *              - LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR: Unsupported version, filters or
 *                filter options.
 *              - LZMA_PROG_ERROR: Invalid values like compressed_size == 0.
 *
 * \note        This doesn&apos;t check that all the options are valid i.e. this
 *              may return LZMA_OK even if lzma_block_header_encode() or
 *              lzma_block_encoder() would fail. If you want to validate the
 *              filter chain, consider using lzma_memlimit_encoder() which as
 *              a side-effect validates the filter chain.

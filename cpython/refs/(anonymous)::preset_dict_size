	 * \brief       Size of the preset dictionary
	 *
	 * Specifies the size of the preset dictionary. If the size is
	 * bigger than dict_size, only the last dict_size bytes are
	 * processed.
	 *
	 * This variable is read only when preset_dict is not NULL.
	 * If preset_dict is not NULL but preset_dict_size is zero,
	 * no preset dictionary is used (identical to only setting
	 * preset_dict to NULL).

 * \brief       Get the total amount of physical memory (RAM) in bytes
 *
 * This function may be useful when determining a reasonable memory
 * usage limit for decompressing or how much memory it is OK to use
 * for compressing.
 *
 * \return      On success, the total amount of physical memory in bytes
 *              is returned. If the amount of RAM cannot be determined,
 *              zero is returned. This can happen if an error occurs
 *              or if there is no code in liblzma to detect the amount
 *              of RAM on the specific operating system.

 * \brief       Single-call .xz Stream decoder
 *
 * \param       memlimit    Pointer to how much memory the decoder is allowed
 *                          to allocate. The value pointed by this pointer is
 *                          modified if and only if LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR is
 *                          returned.
 * \param       flags       Bitwise-or of zero or more of the decoder flags:
 *                          LZMA_TELL_NO_CHECK, LZMA_TELL_UNSUPPORTED_CHECK,
 *                          LZMA_CONCATENATED. Note that LZMA_TELL_ANY_CHECK
 *                          is not allowed and will return LZMA_PROG_ERROR.
 * \param       allocator   lzma_allocator for custom allocator functions.
 *                          Set to NULL to use malloc() and free().
 * \param       in          Beginning of the input buffer
 * \param       in_pos      The next byte will be read from in[*in_pos].
 *                          *in_pos is updated only if decoding succeeds.
 * \param       in_size     Size of the input buffer; the first byte that
 *                          won&apos;t be read is in[in_size].
 * \param       out         Beginning of the output buffer
 * \param       out_pos     The next byte will be written to out[*out_pos].
 *                          *out_pos is updated only if decoding succeeds.
 * \param       out_size    Size of the out buffer; the first byte into
 *                          which no data is written to is out[out_size].
 *
 * \return      - LZMA_OK: Decoding was successful.
 *              - LZMA_FORMAT_ERROR
 *              - LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR
 *              - LZMA_DATA_ERROR
 *              - LZMA_NO_CHECK: This can be returned only if using
 *                the LZMA_TELL_NO_CHECK flag.
 *              - LZMA_UNSUPPORTED_CHECK: This can be returned only if using
 *                the LZMA_TELL_UNSUPPORTED_CHECK flag.
 *              - LZMA_MEM_ERROR
 *              - LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR: Memory usage limit was reached.
 *                The minimum required memlimit value was stored to *memlimit.
 *              - LZMA_BUF_ERROR: Output buffer was too small.
 *              - LZMA_PROG_ERROR

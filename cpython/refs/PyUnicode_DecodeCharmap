<doc f='codebrowser/Include/unicodeobject.h' l='1616'>/* --- Character Map Codecs -----------------------------------------------

   This codec uses mappings to encode and decode characters.

   Decoding mappings must map byte ordinals (integers in the range from 0 to
   255) to Unicode strings, integers (which are then interpreted as Unicode
   ordinals) or None.  Unmapped data bytes (ones which cause a LookupError)
   as well as mapped to None, 0xFFFE or &apos;\ufffe&apos; are treated as &quot;undefined
   mapping&quot; and cause an error.

   Encoding mappings must map Unicode ordinal integers to bytes objects,
   integers in the range from 0 to 255 or None.  Unmapped character
   ordinals (ones which cause a LookupError) as well as mapped to
   None are treated as &quot;undefined mapping&quot; and cause an error.

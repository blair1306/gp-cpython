 * \brief       Calculate memory usage of lzma_index
 *
 * On disk, the size of the Index field depends on both the number of Records
 * stored and how big values the Records store (due to variable-length integer
 * encoding). When the Index is kept in lzma_index structure, the memory usage
 * depends only on the number of Records/Blocks stored in the Index(es), and
 * in case of concatenated lzma_indexes, the number of Streams. The size in
 * RAM is almost always significantly bigger than in the encoded form on disk.
 *
 * This function calculates an approximate amount of memory needed hold
 * the given number of Streams and Blocks in lzma_index structure. This
 * value may vary between CPU architectures and also between liblzma versions
 * if the internal implementation is modified.

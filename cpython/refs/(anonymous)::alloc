	 * \brief       Pointer to a custom memory allocation function
	 *
	 * If you don&apos;t want a custom allocator, but still want
	 * custom free(), set this to NULL and liblzma will use
	 * the standard malloc().
	 *
	 * \param       opaque  lzma_allocator.opaque (see below)
	 * \param       nmemb   Number of elements like in calloc(). liblzma
	 *                      will always set nmemb to 1, so it is safe to
	 *                      ignore nmemb in a custom allocator if you like.
	 *                      The nmemb argument exists only for
	 *                      compatibility with zlib and libbzip2.
	 * \param       size    Size of an element in bytes.
	 *                      liblzma never sets this to zero.
	 *
	 * \return      Pointer to the beginning of a memory block of
	 *              `size&apos; bytes, or NULL if allocation fails
	 *              for some reason. When allocation fails, functions
	 *              of liblzma return LZMA_MEM_ERROR.
	 *
	 * The allocator should not waste time zeroing the allocated buffers.
	 * This is not only about speed, but also memory usage, since the
	 * operating system kernel doesn&apos;t necessarily allocate the requested
	 * memory in physical memory until it is actually used. With small
	 * input files, liblzma may actually need only a fraction of the
	 * memory that it requested for allocation.
	 *
	 * \note        LZMA_MEM_ERROR is also used when the size of the
	 *              allocation would be greater than SIZE_MAX. Thus,
	 *              don&apos;t assume that the custom allocator must have
	 *              returned NULL if some function from liblzma
	 *              returns LZMA_MEM_ERROR.

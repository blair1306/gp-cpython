<doc f='codebrowser/Python/compile.c' l='139'>/* This struct captures the global state of a compilation.

The u pointer points to the current compilation unit, while units
for enclosing blocks are stored in c_stack.     The u and c_stack are
managed by compiler_enter_scope() and compiler_exit_scope().

Note that we don&apos;t track recursion levels during compilation - the
task of detecting and rejecting excessive levels of nesting is
handled by the symbol analysis pass.

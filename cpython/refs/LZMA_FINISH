		 * \brief       Finish encoding of the current Block
		 *
		 * All the input data going to the current Block must have
		 * been given to the encoder (the last bytes can still be
		 * pending in* next_in). Call lzma_code() with LZMA_FULL_FLUSH
		 * until it returns LZMA_STREAM_END. Then continue normally
		 * with LZMA_RUN or finish the Stream with LZMA_FINISH.
		 *
		 * This action is currently supported only by Stream encoder
		 * and easy encoder (which uses Stream encoder). If there is
		 * no unfinished Block, no empty Block is created.

 * \brief       Get the memory usage of decoder filter chain
 *
 * This function is currently supported only when *strm has been initialized
 * with a function that takes a memlimit argument. With other functions, you
 * should use e.g. lzma_raw_encoder_memusage() or lzma_raw_decoder_memusage()
 * to estimate the memory requirements.
 *
 * This function is useful e.g. after LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR to find out how big
 * the memory usage limit should have been to decode the input. Note that
 * this may give misleading information if decoding .xz Streams that have
 * multiple Blocks, because each Block can have different memory requirements.
 *
 * \return      How much memory is currently allocated for the filter
 *              decoders. If no filter chain is currently allocated,
 *              some non-zero value is still returned, which is less than
 *              or equal to what any filter chain would indicate as its
 *              memory requirement.
 *
 *              If this function isn&apos;t supported by *strm or some other error
 *              occurs, zero is returned.

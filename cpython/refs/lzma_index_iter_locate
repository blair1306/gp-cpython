 * \brief       Locate a Block
 *
 * If it is possible to seek in the .xz file, it is possible to parse
 * the Index field(s) and use lzma_index_iter_locate() to do random-access
 * reading with granularity of Block size.
 *
 * \param       iter    Iterator that was earlier initialized with
 *                      lzma_index_iter_init().
 * \param       target  Uncompressed target offset which the caller would
 *                      like to locate from the Stream
 *
 * If the target is smaller than the uncompressed size of the Stream (can be
 * checked with lzma_index_uncompressed_size()):
 *  - Information about the Stream and Block containing the requested
 *    uncompressed offset is stored into *iter.
 *  - Internal state of the iterator is adjusted so that
 *    lzma_index_iter_next() can be used to read subsequent Blocks or Streams.
 *  - This function returns false.
 *
 * If target is greater than the uncompressed size of the Stream, *iter
 * is not modified, and this function returns true.

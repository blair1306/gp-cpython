	 * \brief       Nice length of a match
	 *
	 * This determines how many bytes the encoder compares from the match
	 * candidates when looking for the best match. Once a match of at
	 * least nice_len bytes long is found, the encoder stops looking for
	 * better candidates and encodes the match. (Naturally, if the found
	 * match is actually longer than nice_len, the actual length is
	 * encoded; it&apos;s not truncated to nice_len.)
	 *
	 * Bigger values usually increase the compression ratio and
	 * compression time. For most files, 32 to 128 is a good value,
	 * which gives very good compression ratio at good speed.
	 *
	 * The exact minimum value depends on the match finder. The maximum
	 * is 273, which is the maximum length of a match that LZMA1 and
	 * LZMA2 can encode.

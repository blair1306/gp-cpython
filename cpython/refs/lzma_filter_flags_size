 * \brief       Calculate encoded size of a Filter Flags field
 *
 * Knowing the size of Filter Flags is useful to know when allocating
 * memory to hold the encoded Filter Flags.
 *
 * \param       size    Pointer to integer to hold the calculated size
 * \param       filter  Filter ID and associated options whose encoded
 *                      size is to be calculated
 *
 * \return      - LZMA_OK: *size set successfully. Note that this doesn&apos;t
 *                guarantee that filter-&gt;options is valid, thus
 *                lzma_filter_flags_encode() may still fail.
 *              - LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR: Unknown Filter ID or unsupported options.
 *              - LZMA_PROG_ERROR: Invalid options
 *
 * \note        If you need to calculate size of List of Filter Flags,
 *              you need to loop over every lzma_filter entry.

 * \brief       Calculate Unpadded Size
 *
 * The Index field stores Unpadded Size and Uncompressed Size. The latter
 * can be taken directly from the lzma_block structure after coding a Block,
 * but Unpadded Size needs to be calculated from Block Header Size,
 * Compressed Size, and size of the Check field. This is where this function
 * is needed.
 *
 * \return      Unpadded Size on success, or zero on error.

		 * \brief       Make all the input available at output
		 *
		 * Normally the encoder introduces some latency.
		 * LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH forces all the buffered data to be
		 * available at output without resetting the internal
		 * state of the encoder. This way it is possible to use
		 * compressed stream for example for communication over
		 * network.
		 *
		 * Only some filters support LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH. Trying to use
		 * LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH with filters that don&apos;t support it will
		 * make lzma_code() return LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR. For example,
		 * LZMA1 doesn&apos;t support LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH but LZMA2 does.
		 *
		 * Using LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH very often can dramatically reduce
		 * the compression ratio. With some filters (for example,
		 * LZMA2), fine-tuning the compression options may help
		 * mitigate this problem significantly (for example,
		 * match finder with LZMA2).
		 *
		 * Decoders don&apos;t support LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH.

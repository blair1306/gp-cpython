 * pre-order traversal. To keep track of which sub-element should be returned
 * next, a stack of parents is maintained. This is a standard stack-based
 * iterative pre-order traversal of a tree.
 * The stack is managed using a continuous array.
 * Each stack item contains the saved parent to which we should return after
 * the current one is exhausted, and the next child to examine in that parent.

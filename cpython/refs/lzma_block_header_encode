 * \brief       Encode Block Header
 *
 * The caller must have calculated the size of the Block Header already with
 * lzma_block_header_size(). If a value larger than the one calculated by
 * lzma_block_header_size() is used, the Block Header will be padded to the
 * specified size.
 *
 * \param       out         Beginning of the output buffer. This must be
 *                          at least block-&gt;header_size bytes.
 * \param       block       Block options to be encoded.
 *
 * \return      - LZMA_OK: Encoding was successful. block-&gt;header_size
 *                bytes were written to output buffer.
 *              - LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR: Invalid or unsupported options.
 *              - LZMA_PROG_ERROR: Invalid arguments, for example
 *                block-&gt;header_size is invalid or block-&gt;filters is NULL.

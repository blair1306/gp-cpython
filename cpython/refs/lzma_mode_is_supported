 * \brief       Test if given compression mode is supported
 *
 * Return true if the given compression mode is supported by this liblzma
 * build. Otherwise false is returned. It is safe to call this with a value
 * that isn&apos;t listed in lzma_mode enumeration; the return value will be false.
 *
 * There is no way to list which modes are available in this particular
 * liblzma version and build. It would be useless, because a new compression
 * mode, which the application developer wasn&apos;t aware, could require giving
 * additional options to the encoder that the older modes don&apos;t need.

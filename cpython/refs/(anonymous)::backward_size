	 * \brief       Backward Size
	 *
	 * Backward Size must be a multiple of four bytes. In this Stream
	 * format version, Backward Size is the size of the Index field.
	 *
	 * Backward Size isn&apos;t actually part of the Stream Flags field, but
	 * it is convenient to include in this structure anyway. Backward
	 * Size is present only in the Stream Footer. There is no need to
	 * initialize backward_size when encoding Stream Header.
	 *
	 * lzma_stream_header_decode() always sets backward_size to
	 * LZMA_VLI_UNKNOWN so that it is convenient to use
	 * lzma_stream_flags_compare() when both Stream Header and Stream
	 * Footer have been decoded.

 * \brief       Calculate approximate memory requirements for raw encoder
 *
 * This function can be used to calculate the memory requirements for
 * Block and Stream encoders too because Block and Stream encoders don&apos;t
 * need significantly more memory than raw encoder.
 *
 * \param       filters     Array of filters terminated with
 *                          .id == LZMA_VLI_UNKNOWN.
 *
 * \return      Number of bytes of memory required for the given
 *              filter chain when encoding. If an error occurs,
 *              for example due to unsupported filter chain,
 *              UINT64_MAX is returned.
